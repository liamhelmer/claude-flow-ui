# ADR-001: Node.js Production Architecture Design

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2025-09-15

## Context
We need to design a production-ready Node.js hello world application that demonstrates enterprise-grade patterns, scalability, and operational excellence. The application should serve as a reference implementation for production Node.js services.

## Decision
We will implement a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, structured logging, health checks, graceful shutdown, and robust testing strategies.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supports horizontal and vertical scaling
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain
- **Observability**: Structured logging and metrics enable effective monitoring
- **Reliability**: Health checks and graceful shutdown improve system reliability
- **Security**: Built-in security patterns protect against common vulnerabilities
- **Testability**: Comprehensive testing structure ensures code quality

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional layers and patterns increase initial complexity
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand architectural patterns
- **Resource Overhead**: Monitoring and logging consume additional resources

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Folder Structure
**Decision**: Implement feature-based modular structure with clear layer separation
- `src/app/` - Presentation layer (controllers, routes, middleware)
- `src/core/` - Business logic layer (services, models)
- `src/infrastructure/` - Infrastructure layer (database, cache, external APIs)
- `src/config/` - Configuration management
- `src/utils/` - Shared utilities

**Rationale**: This structure follows Domain-Driven Design principles and makes the codebase more maintainable and testable.

### 2. Configuration Management
**Decision**: Use hierarchical configuration with environment variables taking precedence
- Environment variables (highest priority)
- Environment-specific config files
- Default configuration (lowest priority)

**Rationale**: This approach provides flexibility for different deployment environments while maintaining security for sensitive data.

### 3. Health Checks
**Decision**: Implement three levels of health checks
- `/health/live` - Liveness probe (basic availability)
- `/health/ready` - Readiness probe (ready to serve traffic)
- `/health` - Comprehensive health information

**Rationale**: Different health check levels support Kubernetes deployment patterns and provide appropriate monitoring granularity.

### 4. Error Handling
**Decision**: Implement hierarchical error classes with centralized error handling middleware
- Custom error classes for different error types
- Global error handler middleware
- Structured error responses

**Rationale**: Consistent error handling improves debugging and client integration while maintaining security.

### 5. Logging
**Decision**: Use structured logging with Winston
- JSON format for production
- Multiple log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Contextual metadata inclusion

**Rationale**: Structured logging enables better log analysis and monitoring in production environments.

### 6. Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Follow testing pyramid approach
- 70% Unit tests
- 20% Integration tests
- 10% End-to-end tests

**Rationale**: This distribution provides comprehensive coverage while maintaining fast feedback loops during development.

### 7. Security
**Decision**: Implement defense-in-depth security strategy
- Security headers (Helmet.js)
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Authentication/Authorization framework

**Rationale**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors and comply with security best practices.

### 8. Graceful Shutdown
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive graceful shutdown handling
- Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Connection draining
- Resource cleanup
- Timeout-based force shutdown

**Rationale**: Graceful shutdown prevents data loss and improves user experience during deployments.

### 9. Monitoring and Observability
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive observability stack
- Prometheus metrics
- Structured logging
- Request tracing
- Performance monitoring

**Rationale**: Comprehensive observability enables effective production monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 10. Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Container-first deployment with Kubernetes support
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Non-root container execution
- Kubernetes manifests
- Health check integration

**Rationale**: Containerization provides consistency across environments and enables modern deployment patterns.

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Development Teams
1. Follow the established folder structure
2. Implement proper error handling for all endpoints
3. Add comprehensive tests for new features
4. Use structured logging with appropriate context
5. Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
6. Follow security best practices

### For Operations Teams
1. Configure monitoring and alerting based on health checks
2. Set up log aggregation and analysis
3. Implement proper backup and disaster recovery
4. Configure autoscaling based on metrics
5. Regular security scanning and updates

### For Security Teams
1. Regular security audits of dependencies
2. Penetration testing of deployed applications
3. Security configuration reviews
4. Incident response procedures

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Microframework (Fastify) vs Express
**Decision**: Express
**Rationale**: Better ecosystem, more middleware options, team familiarity

### 2. TypeScript vs JavaScript
**Decision**: JavaScript (with JSDoc for type hints)
**Rationale**: Simpler setup for reference implementation, easier adoption

### 3. Monolithic vs Microservices
**Decision**: Modular monolith
**Rationale**: Appropriate for hello world scope, easier to understand and deploy

## Success Metrics
- Application startup time < 2 seconds
- Response time < 100ms for hello world endpoint
- Test coverage > 80%
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- 99.9% uptime in production

## Review Date
This ADR should be reviewed in 6 months (2025-03-15) or when significant architectural changes are proposed.
