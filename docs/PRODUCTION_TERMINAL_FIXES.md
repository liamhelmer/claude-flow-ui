# Production Terminal Switching Fixes

## Overview

Fixed critical production-specific issues with WebSocket connections and terminal input display that occurred when switching between terminals in `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WebSocket Disconnection Problem
**Issue**: WebSocket disconnected aggressively on component unmount in production, breaking terminal connections during rapid terminal switching.

**Fix**: Implemented delayed disconnection with cancellation logic:
- Added 100ms delay before disconnect in production
- Cancel pending disconnects when new terminals mount quickly
- Only disconnect if no active terminals remain

### 2. Missing Debug Output
**Issue**: Limited console logging in production made debugging terminal issues difficult.

**Fix**: Added essential event logging that works in production:
- Log terminal-data, connection-change, and terminal-error events
- Production-safe logging for WebSocket operations
- Enhanced session validation logging

### 3. Event Listener Management
**Issue**: Production optimizations caused duplicate or missing event listeners.

**Fix**: Enhanced listener management:
- Improved duplicate detection in production
- Memory leak protection with aggressive cleanup
- Error handling around callback execution
- Better hot-reload handling in development vs production

### 4. Terminal Display Synchronization
**Issue**: Input not appearing until switching terminals in production mode.

**Fix**: Production-specific rendering optimizations:
- Force synchronous DOM reflow after writing terminal data
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setTimeout` for scrolling
- Add GPU acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Mark terminal containers as active to prevent disconnection

## Files Modified

### `/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
- Added production-safe connection management
- Enhanced event listener logging for essential events
- Implemented delayed disconnection with cancellation

### `/src/lib/websocket/client.ts`
- Added pending disconnect cancellation logic
- Enhanced event listener memory leak protection
- Production-specific error handling around callbacks
- Better connection persistence logic

### `/src/hooks/useTerminal.ts`
- Enhanced WebSocket event registration timing
- Production-safe terminal data handling
- Improved session validation logging
- Force DOM reflow for immediate display updates
- RequestAnimationFrame for better scroll performance

### `/src/components/terminal/Terminal.tsx`
- Production-specific focus management
- GPU acceleration optimizations
- Active terminal marking to prevent disconnection
- Enhanced container reference management

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- Created `tests/production-terminal-switching.test.js`
- Created `scripts/test-production-fixes.js`

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Build in production mode: `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`
2. Start production server: `NODE_ENV=production npm start`
3. Open multiple terminals
4. Switch between terminals rapidly
5. Verify input appears immediately
6. Check browser devtools for connection persistence logs

## Key Production Optimizations

1. **Connection Persistence**: WebSocket connections survive terminal switches
2. **Immediate Display**: Terminal input appears instantly without requiring terminal switch
3. **Memory Management**: Better event listener cleanup prevents memory leaks
4. **Performance**: GPU acceleration and requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
5. **Debugging**: Essential logging available in production for troubleshooting

## Environment-Specific Behavior

### Development
- More verbose logging
- Hot-reload friendly event listener management
- Traditional setTimeout for scrolling

### Production
- Essential-only logging
- Aggressive memory leak prevention
- RequestAnimationFrame for performance
- GPU acceleration enabled
- Connection persistence optimizations

## Verification

✅ Production build successful
✅ WebSocket connection persistence
✅ Event listener management
✅ Terminal state synchronization
✅ Input display immediacy
✅ Memory leak prevention

The fixes ensure that terminal switching works reliably in production mode with immediate input display and persistent WebSocket connections.
