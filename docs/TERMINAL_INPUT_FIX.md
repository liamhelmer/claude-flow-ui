# Terminal Input Fix - Root Cause Analysis and Solution

## Issue Description
Terminal input was not working - characters typed in the user terminal didn't show up.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Race Condition in Terminal Initialization
The terminal was being created before the `sendData` function from WebSocket was available, causing the `onData` handler to not properly send input to the backend.

### Key Problems Identified:

1. **Terminal Creation Before WebSocket Connection**
   - Terminal was initialized with `disableStdin: false` but without a valid `sendData` function
   - The `onData` handler was registered but couldn't send data to the backend

2. **Missing Validation in Terminal Creation**
   - No check to ensure `sendData` function was available before creating terminal
   - Terminal would be created in a broken state and not recreated when `sendData` became available

3. **Focus Management Issues**
   - Terminal not consistently focused after initialization
   - Multiple focus strategies needed for reliability

4. **Session ID Synchronization**
   - Complex session routing logic that could misdirect input
   - Race conditions between API session ID and WebSocket session ID

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Terminal Initialization (`useTerminal.ts`)
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Verify sendData function is available before creating terminal
if (!sendData || typeof sendData !== 'function') {
  console.warn('[Terminal] ðŸš¨ sendData function not available - delaying terminal creation');
  return;
}
```

### 2. Terminal Recreation Logic
- Added logic to recreate terminal if it was created before `sendData` was ready
- Track whether terminal has valid `sendData` function with `_hasValidSendData` flag

### 3. Improved Focus Management
- Multiple focus strategies targeting both terminal and textarea elements
- Enhanced click handler with retry logic
- Better focus validation and recovery

### 4. WebSocket Resilience
- Automatic reconnection attempts when sending data fails
- Better error handling and logging for debugging

## Testing

### Regression Test Created
- Comprehensive Playwright test suite in `tests/regression/terminal-input.spec.js`
- Tests basic character input, special characters, multi-line input, and special keys
- Includes debug capabilities with screenshots and HTML capture

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run the regression test
npm run test:terminal-input

# Run with visual browser
npm run test:terminal-input-playwright

# Debug mode
npx playwright test tests/regression/terminal-input.spec.js --debug
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/hooks/useTerminal.ts` - Core terminal logic and input handling
- `/src/components/terminal/Terminal.tsx` - UI focus management
- `/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Connection resilience
- `/tests/regression/terminal-input.spec.js` - Regression test suite
- `/tests/regression/run-terminal-input-test.sh` - Test runner script

## Verification Steps
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Run regression test: `npm run test:terminal-input`
3. Test should pass, confirming input works
4. Manual test: Type in terminal and verify characters appear immediately

## Prevention
- Always ensure WebSocket connection and `sendData` function are ready before terminal creation
- Add validation checks for critical dependencies
- Include comprehensive regression tests for terminal functionality
- Monitor terminal initialization sequence in production logs
